# NYC_real_estate
Analyzing every Manhattan property sale since 2003

I am learning pandas and decided to look at Manhattan real estate to test my skills.

I analyze over 400,000 real estate transactions to find the evolution of the average price of an apartment by neighborhood over time (see image screenshot).

The dataset is quite rich in details. Some other questions I consider:

Why is javits picking up in price so much?
Does condo/walkup mix matter for neighborhood pricing?
What is the priciest zip code over time?
What neighborhood has the most non-cash transactions?
Is there a prewar premium in NY?

Future projects:
Mapping data over a map of Manhattan
Comparing block by block data for trends
Forecasting prices based on available features
